### **Important Notes**

- **OpenAI API Key**  
  You **must** provide your own OpenAI API key for the AI to function. The flashcards are powered by OpenAI's GPT model, which requires an active API key. You can obtain one by signing up at [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/).

- **Flask Web Server**  
  The program uses Flask to run a local web server. You have to run the program using python3 app.py or python app.py. It won't work if you simply open the index.html file.
